Traffic Report uses Google Maps APIv2 to show the map on the application and the user's location. After getting the exact location, the user can from there switch to 'Report Mode' which allows him to select to street/road that is currently blocked and presses the main button to report it. After that, the application saves the coordiantes, sets a fifteen minute timer for the user and a three hour timer for the report. For fifteen minutes, the user can delete his report, and after three hours the report changes it's to Expired(Road is not blocked anymore).<br/>
